# 🤖 AI & Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my AI/ML project repository! This space showcases a collection of practical implementations, experiments, and mini-projects exploring concepts in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Whether it's classification, regression, clustering, or optimization — each project reflects a step in my learning journey and hands-on experience with real-world datasets, algorithms, and frameworks.
